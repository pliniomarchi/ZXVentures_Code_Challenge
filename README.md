## How does it work

This API provides access for a database of beer salers. ItÂ´s have functions for insert, update and retrieve partners.
You can use the API from a web front-end application, mobile app or other front-end http client.
Here i'm using the Postman to exemplifyed the use of the API.

Note 2: The URL of the examples assume that the installation was done at http://localhost/api

We have 3 methods of access the API:

1. POST
2. PUT
3. GET 

- `POST method` (used to include a new partner): 
   It's accessed using the URL http://localhost/api/partner/ and passing as parameter (document, tradingname, ownername, lat, long, coverarea) as in the following example:
   ![POST method](https://github.com/pliniomarchi/ZXVentures_Code_Challenge/blob/master/img_post.png)

Returns: JSON containing:
["Document is requerid"] if the document is not present in parameters (in the same way for all other parameters, all then is requerid).
or
["Sucess, record added."] if successfully processed


- `PUT method` (used to alter an existing partner): 
   It's accessed using the URL http://localhost/api/partner/{existing partner id} and passing as parameter (document, tradingname, ownername, lat, long, coverarea) as in the following example:
   ![PUT method](https://github.com/pliniomarchi/ZXVentures_Code_Challenge/blob/master/img_put.png)

Returns: JSON containing:
["Partner_id is required."] if the ID is not present in parameters
or
["Document is requerid"] if the document is not present in parameters (in the same way for all other parameters, all then is requerid).
or
["Sucess, record updated."] if successfully processed


- `GET method` (used to return an existing partner by id): 
   It's accessed using the URL http://localhost/api/partner/{existing partner id} as in the following example:
   ![GET method] (https://github.com/pliniomarchi/ZXVentures_Code_Challenge/blob/master/img_get.png)

Returns: JSON containing:
["Partner_id is required."] if the ID is not present in parameters
or
["No data found"] if no record with this id was found
or

        "id": "1",

        "coverarea": "[[18,17],[38,45],[47,52],[18,17]]"
    }
]

   It's accessed using the URL http://localhost/api/nearest/{coord} as in the following example:
